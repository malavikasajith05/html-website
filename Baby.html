        <h3>Plot of Baby's day Out</h3>

        <article>
            Baby Bink couldn't ask for more; <br>
            he has adoring (if somewhat sickly-sweet) parents, he lives in a huge mansion, and is just about to appear in the social pages of the newspaper. <br>
            Unfortunately, not everyone in the world is as nice as his parents; especially the three enterprising kidnappers who pretend to be photographers from the newspaper. <br>
            Successfully kidnapping him, they have a harder time keeping hold of him, who not only keeps one step ahead of them, but seems to be more than a little bit smarter than them.<br>
